### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Amelie,

I used to write content for websites and promote them. That's before I found how much more fun building websites is, so I do that now.

:woman_technologist: My self-taught programming journey started in 2021 with HTML, CSS and JavaScript by following w3schools' courses, then I went on to complete the Responsive Web Design Certification as well as the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification with FreeCodeCamp. The Odin Project's foundational course was also a great way to cement my new-found knowledge before starting a 6-month program to learn full-stack web development with CareerFoundry. 

:mechanical_arm: I learned both frontend and backend developement by building projects that you can find right here on Github, check out my repositories to see some of my work. Here are some skills that I have built-up:
- Writing applications in JavaScript and TypeScript
- Using Frontend Libraries and Frameworks: React, React Native and Angular
- Using CSS frameworks: Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS (my personal favorite)
- Implementing backend: Node.js, Express, serverless functions with AWS
- Database: Relational database with PostgreSQL and non-relational database with MongoDB and Firebase
- Creating my own REST API as well as implementating other APIs into my applications, for example, the google calendar API.
- Test-driven development with Jest and Enzyme as well as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
- Agile project management
